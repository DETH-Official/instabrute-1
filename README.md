1091 is the number of passwords in the pass.txt file.

[*] Do you want to use proxy (y/n):
```
If you will type y means yes, it will use proxies which are in proxy.txt 
If you will type n means no, it will brute from your ip which is not recommended.
Now, don't touch anything. It will try to find if one of the passwords in pass.txt is the real password of victim.
